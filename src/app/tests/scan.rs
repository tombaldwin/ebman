//! Shared source-scanning primitives for the drift guards.
//!
//! Twelve guards in this crate walk `src/` looking for a pattern in
//! production code, and eight of them stripped comments with the same
//! line:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let code = line.split("//").next().unwrap_or("");
//! ```
//!
//! which truncates at the first `//` **anywhere on the line, including
//! inside a string literal**. `src/util.rs:744` is
//! `Some(format!("https://{}", host.replace(…)))` — everything after
//! `https:` was invisible to every one of those guards. That is not
//! theoretical: it was demonstrated by planting an `arboard::Clipboard`
//! call after a URL literal on one line, which
//! `the_clipboard_is_only_reached_through_yank` — a guard whose entire
//! job is stopping tests from touching the developer's machine — passed
//! clean. Moving the same call *before* the URL made it fail, which
//! isolates the cause exactly.
//!
//! The lesson had already been learned once here and not generalised:
//! `literals_with_embedded_newlines` lexes with `proc_macro2` precisely
//! because five hand-rolled literal scanners were each wrong
//! differently. This is that fix applied to the other eight.
